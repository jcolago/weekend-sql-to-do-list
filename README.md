# SQL To-Do List

## Description
This is my weekend project for SQL week. This simple app takes in a task entered by the user, stores it in the database and displays it on the page. Entries can be marked as completed or deleted from the list.

# Prerequisites

3. Install express by entering "npm i express" in terminal.

4. Install postgresql by entering "npm i pg" in terminal.

5. Start server with "npm start"

# Usage
